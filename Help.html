Accessibility
One of the most important aspects of any page is accessibility, but it’s even more critical for help pages. Help pages should be simply and quickly accessible.
Link to them in the header and footer, especially on long pages and the home page. Users shouldn’t have to dig into deeply buried pages. The experience should be straightforward.
For example, Traffik puts clear links on a plain background to increase readability.
