use the git --bar system to update the beta and production website
on mgl2 there is two barre repo in /usr/local/repos/ and they are hook to the www projects/mesoscope and projects/mesoscopebeta

alternative for the hook can be found here :
https://gist.github.com/noelboss/3fe13927025b89757f8fb12e9066f2fa
on the local git clone working copy simply add the two remote
git clone orca:/mnt/raid/services/git/mesoscope.git
git remote add live ssh://autin@mgl2.scripps.edu/usr/local/repo/mesoscope_release.git
git remote add beta ssh://autin@mgl2.scripps.edu/usr/local/repo/mesoscope_beta.git

for developement
git push origin master
for testing online
git push beta master
for deploying
git push live master

alternative could be to use the hook directly on origin but for a particular branch
